## Introduction

Building complex, modular Angular applications requires a solid understanding of dependency injection (DI) and services. These cornerstone features work hand-in-hand to deliver flexibility, maintainability, and testability to your Angular project.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `https://github.com/madhurajayashanka/di-services-angular-demo` with the URL of your GitHub repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
   Replace `di-services-angular-demo with the name of the directory created when you cloned the repository.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will install all the project dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

4. **Serve the Angular Project:**
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
   This command builds the application and starts a development server. By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:4200/`.

5. **Access the Application:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the running Angular application.

If you encounter any issues during the installation or running of the project, make sure to check the console for error messages and resolve them accordingly.
